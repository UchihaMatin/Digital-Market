# Digital Shop Web Project  

This is a simple and dynamic digital shop project, built to practice and showcase my JavaScript skills. The project is designed as a **mini project** that will constantly evolve as I learn new concepts in JavaScript and web development.  

## Features  
- Dynamic product display using JavaScript.  
- Data managed with an array of objects (acts as a simple database).  
- Responsive design powered by **Bootstrap 5** and **Sass**.  
- Future updates will include a shopping cart and additional features.  

## Project Goals  
This project is an educational and growing endeavor to:  
1. Practice JavaScript skills in a real-world scenario.  
2. Improve dynamic web development techniques.  
3. Continuously update and enhance the project as I progress.
